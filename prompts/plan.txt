My institution has a compute cluster which uses the LSF cluster job scheduler.  Our deployment has a few custom options that can be used when submitting a new job which select the node type, queue name, GPU type, etc.

One can read the documentation to determine the correct invocation of "bsub" for a given task, but it would be nice if a text-based "wizard" could guide the user through the various options at their disposal and construct the corresponding invocation of bsub.  I want to create that wizard.

Since many of us are Python programmers, I'd like the wizard to be written in Python.  It should use a modern library for text UIs.  I'm aware of "textual" (based on "rich"), but I'd like to consider other frameworks if any other appropriate choices exist.

I've exported our internal documentation about the compute cluster to a file in this directory named jrc-cluster-docs/janelia-cluster-wiki-export.txt.  (It was exported from HTML to txt, so some of the formatting might be strange, but I think the important parts are interpretable.)

Please create a plan for how you would construct such an app.  Write the plan file(s) in Markdown.
